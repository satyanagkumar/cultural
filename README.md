Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   https://github.com/Narsimhareddy28/recepie.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd recepie
3. Install dependencies using npm:
   mpm install

MongoDB Setup:

1. Creating a Cluster in MongoDB Cloud:

   - Log in to your MongoDB Cloud account or sign up if you haven't already.
   - Once logged in, navigate to the MongoDB Cloud dashboard.
   - Click on the "Clusters" option in the menu.
   - Click on the "Build a New Cluster" button.
   - Choose your preferred cloud provider, region, cluster tier, and additional settings as needed.
   - Give your cluster a name and click on the "Create Cluster" button.

2. Configuring Cluster Settings (Optional):

   - Depending on your requirements, you may want to configure additional settings such as backup options, network settings, and security configurations. You can do this from the cluster settings dashboard.

3. Obtaining Connection Details:

   - Once your cluster is created, navigate to the cluster dashboard.
   - Look for the "Connect" button and click on it.
   - Choose your connection method. For this example, let's select "Connect Your Application".
   - MongoDB will provide you with a connection string. This string includes details such as the database username, password, hostname, port, and database name. Keep this information secure as it will be used to connect to your database.

4. Connecting to the Cloud Database:
   - Now that you have the connection string, you can use it in your application code to connect to your MongoDB Cloud database.
   - Depending on your programming language and MongoDB driver, the code to connect will vary. But generally, you'll use the provided connection string to establish a connection to the database.
   - Ensure that you have the necessary MongoDB driver installed in your project. You can find instructions for installing the driver specific to your programming language in the MongoDB documentation.
   - Once the connection is established, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your MongoDB Cloud database just like you would with a locally hosted MongoDB database.
